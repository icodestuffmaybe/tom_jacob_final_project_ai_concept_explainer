# 🔍 Search Fix Documentation

## Issue Identified

The Wikipedia search was returning 0 sources because:

1. **Multi-word keywords** like "Vector Representation" weren't URL-encoded properly
2. **Direct page lookup** failed for complex terms 
3. **No fallback mechanism** when direct lookup failed
4. **Limited error handling** made debugging difficult

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Improved Keyword Extraction**
```python
# Before: Generic keyword extraction
"embeddings" → ["Vector Representation", "Word Embeddings", "Natural Language Processing"]

# After: Wikipedia-focused extraction  
"embeddings" → ["embeddings", "machine learning", "artificial intelligence", "computer science"]
```

### 2. **Enhanced Wikipedia Search**
- **URL Encoding**: Properly handles multi-word terms
- **Fallback Search**: Uses Wikipedia Search API when direct page fails
- **Better Error Handling**: Detailed logging for debugging
- **Multiple Attempts**: Tries up to 3 keywords until one succeeds

### 3. **Search Process Flow**
```
Query: "What are embeddings?"
  ↓
1. Extract Keywords: ["embeddings", "machine learning", "vectors"]  
  ↓
2. Try "embeddings" → Direct page lookup with URL encoding
  ↓  
3. If fails → Try Wikipedia Search API
  ↓
4. If still fails → Try next keyword "machine learning"
  ↓
5. Success → Return source with title, URL, snippet
```

## 🧪 How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Use the test script
```bash
# Make sure backend is running first
start_streaming.bat

# Then in another terminal:
python test_search_fix.py
```

### Option 2: Test manually in the app
1. Start the app: `start_streaming.bat`
2. Try these queries that previously failed:
   - "embeddings"
   - "machine learning"  
   - "neural networks"
   - "what is photosynthesis"

### Expected Results
✅ **Before Fix**: "Found 0 sources" in backend logs
✅ **After Fix**: "Found 1 source" with actual Wikipedia content

## 🔧 Technical Details

### New Wikipedia Search Implementation
```python
async def search_wikipedia(self, keyword: str):
    # 1. Try direct page summary with URL encoding
    encoded_keyword = urllib.parse.quote(keyword.replace(' ', '_'))
    summary_url = f"https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/{encoded_keyword}"
    
    # 2. Fallback to search API
    if direct_lookup_fails:
        search_params = {
            'action': 'query', 'format': 'json',
            'list': 'search', 'srsearch': keyword, 'srlimit': 1
        }
        # Then get summary for found page
```

### Better Keyword Strategy  
```python
# Old approach - too specific/academic
"embeddings" → ["Vector Representation", "Word Embeddings", "Natural Language Processing"]

# New approach - Wikipedia-friendly  
"embeddings" → ["embeddings", "machine learning", "artificial intelligence", "vectors"]
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Single source limit**: Only return 1 source for speed
- **5-second timeout**: Prevents hanging on slow requests  
- **Early exit**: Stop searching after first successful result
- **Detailed logging**: Shows exactly what's happening

## 🎯 Expected Improvements

| Query Type | Before | After |
|------------|--------|-------|
| "embeddings" | 0 sources | 1 source (Machine Learning page) |
| "photosynthesis" | 0 sources | 1 source (Photosynthesis page) |
| "what is gravity" | 0 sources | 1 source (Gravity page) |
| Multi-word terms | Failed | Works with encoding |
| Complex queries | No fallback | Search API fallback |

## 🚨 Backend Logs to Watch For

### ✅ Success Pattern:
```
🔍 Processing query: embeddings
📝 Extracting keywords...
   Keywords: ['embeddings', 'machine learning', 'artificial intelligence']
🌐 Searching for sources...
   🔍 Searching for: 'embeddings'
   📡 Trying direct page: https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/embeddings
   ✅ Direct page found: Embedding
   ✅ Found source for: 'embeddings'  
   Found 1 sources
🧠 Generating explanation with sources...
✅ Explanation complete!
```

### ❌ Old Failure Pattern:
```
🔍 Processing query: embeddings  
📝 Extracting keywords...
   Keywords: ['Vector Representation', 'Word Embeddings'] 
🌐 Searching for sources...
   Found 0 sources
🧠 Generating explanation without sources...
✅ Explanation complete!
```

The fix ensures that virtually all educational queries will find relevant Wikipedia sources!
